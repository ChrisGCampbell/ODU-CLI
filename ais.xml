<DESCRIPTION>Check and correct issues with the "Append Link" function in Write/Add Comment.
</DESCRIPTION>
<RATIONALE>Fix for a current problem: In write_comment, one can add a URL into the comment. The URL box shows
http:// 
and the user can write the rest of the URL into this box and then click on "Append Link." This works fine and the link in the comment text is clickable. However, if I change
http://
to
https:// in the box and then append the link, it will not be clickable.

<RATIONALE>Additional functionality: The function display_selected_uploads(upload_item) works very well. We get a table showing the uploaded files in a category. See, for example, "Library" in http://www.mari-odu.org/cl/workspace. Currently, we use the same functions to show a list of graphics, but the list does not include a small picture of each graphics.
